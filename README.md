## Vision

The Open Service Management Framework is a framework or template for practicing Service Management across
organizations of all sizes, types, industries, and locales. It is defined and maintained by the community
for the community, as a way to share a common language and best practices for common processes and disciplines
across service-oriented organizations (inspired by the processes that IT departments have been using for the
last several decades).

It is a living document, open to change and improvement by the community as technology and knowledge continue
to advance. At certain points, we may publish "snapshots" in the interest of being able to refer to specific
revisions of the document.

It is not intended as a direct response to or evolution of any existing framework. Where aspects of existing
frameworks make sense, we may include our own interpretation as part of this framework; where we have found
other recommendations to be less helpful or ambiguous, we have chosen to describe practices and recommendations
based on our own experiences.

It is practical, but not prescriptive. It is intended to provide a common vocabulary for Service Management
professionals and organizations, with recommendations on how we have found the concepts to relate to each other
in useful ways. However, our recommendations may not be appropriate for all organizations; use what makes sense
and makes it easy to incorporate guidance from your peers.

It is completely open. The "specification", for lack of a better word, is licensed as indicated below so that
everyone can read and understand the full text of the Open Service Management Framework. This does not preclude
anyone from providing paid training or certifications, though we reserve the right to formalize a process for
authorizing specific certification processes for practitioners, vendors, and trainers.

## Contributing

This git repository is open for Pull Requests. However, due to the nature of git, we encourage proposal and
discussion of changes and improvements via Github issues so that the Pull Requests can be small and less prone
to conflicts.

This is a community project; _anyone_ is welcome to submit a proposal and contribute to a discussion. By doing
so, you agree to be respectful of differing perspectives, cultures, experiences, backgrounds -- we want the best
possible recommendations, but never at the expense of our community.

## Disclaimer

Any similarities to other frameworks is purely coincidental. All definitions, descriptions, and recommendations
contained herein are the result of our contributors’ own experiences in their own companies and careers. In the
event they bear similarities to other recommendations, it is because we also feel it is a “good idea”; in the
interest of ensuring we have produced the best possible recommendations, we have not arbitrarily made different
recommendations. However, to avoid any perception of infringement, we have used terms we feel are as good or
better when the specific choice of word was non-critical to our shared language and understanding.
