# Structure of the Open Service Management Framework

## Disciplines

The OSMF is organized into a collection of "disciplines" (other frameworks call them "practices" or "processes").

We've tried to organize the disciplines in the order that most organizations tend to adopt them. For instance,
all organizations have some process for dealing with incidents, whether or not it's formalized, but might not
have a process for addressing problems or managing assets.

Examples of OSMF disciplines:

- Incident Resolution
- Problem Management
- Configuration Management
- Change Management
- Asset Management
- Service Definition
- Experience Management
- Service Channel Selection

## Discipline Details

Each discipline is organized to support three outcomes: a shared vocabulary for discussing how work is done,
a concrete path to get started, and guidance for adapting the practice when the template does not fit. The
content is structured under the following headings:

- Primary Objects/Actors - definitions of the one or two entities that are tracked or managed
- Supporting Objects/Actors - definitions of other entities that contain additional details
- Related Objects/Actors - entities that come from other disciplines (or may be tracked by other systems and processes)
- Lifecycles - if there is a sequence of stages used in this discipline, this section explains why and how
- Getting Started - a minimal template for adopting the discipline, plus when and why to introduce it (including problems or pain that may indicate the discipline is worth introducing)
- Processes - examples of putting the discipline into practice, drawn from contributors' experiences
- Adaptation - how to evolve the practice for your organization when the template does not fit, how to make decisions without prescriptive rules, and pitfalls to avoid.

The framework prioritizes three outcomes for each discipline:

- Shared vocabulary - consistent terms and concepts so that teams can discuss "how we do things" with their peers.
- Getting started - a minimal template for adoption, plus when and why to introduce the discipline (including problems or pain that may indicate it is worth introducing).
- Adaptation - guidance for evolving the practice when the template does not fit, including how to make decisions for your own organization and pitfalls to watch out for.
