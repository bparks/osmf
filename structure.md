# Structure of the Open Service Management Framework

## Disciplines

The OSMF is organized into a collection of "disciplines" (other frameworks call them "practices" or "processes").

We've tried to organize the disciplines in the order that most organizations tend to adopt them. For instance,
all organizations have some process for dealing with incidents, whether or not it's formalized, but might not
have a process for addressing problems or managing assets.

Examples of OSMF disciplines:

- Incident Resolution
- Problem Management
- Configuration Management
- Change Management
- Asset Management
- Service Definition
- Experience Management
- Service Channel Selection

## Discipline Details

Each discipline is organized into a section describing the most important concepts in successfully practicing
the discipline (some of which might correspond to entities in a software system) and a set of recommended
processes and subprocesses, roughly corrspoding to the following headings:

- Primary Objects/Actors - definitions of the one or two entities that are tracked or managed
- Supporting Objects/Actors - definitions of other entities that contain additional details
- Related Objects/Actors - entities that come from other disciplines (or may be tracked by other systems and processes)
- Lifecycles - if there's a sequence of stages that is used in this discipline, this section explains why and how
- Processes - various examples of how to put this discipline into practice based on contributors' experiences.
