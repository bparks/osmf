# Service Channel Selection

Choosing and shaping how users access services and support—portal, phone, chat, email, walk-up, or automation—so that the right channel is available for the right need and the organization can deliver effectively. Organizations use channel selection to match user preference and capability to cost, capacity, and quality.

## Primary Objects/Actors

- **Channel** — A distinct way that users request or access a service or get support: e.g., self-service portal, phone, chat, email, walk-up desk, or automated flow. Each channel is one "path" that the organization offers; it has its own capacity, cost, and typical use cases.
- **User / Consumer** — The person or group who chooses (or is guided to) a channel. User preference, ability, and context drive which channels are used and how they perform.

## Supporting Objects/Actors

- **Channel capability** — What the channel can do: e.g., "portal can submit requests and check status," "phone can handle urgent and complex issues." Capabilities influence which requests and which users are suited to each channel.
- **Channel performance** — How the channel performs: volume, resolution rate, cost per contact, satisfaction. Used to decide where to invest (e.g., improve self-service) or where to steer users (e.g., "use the portal for this").

## Related Objects/Actors

- **Service** — Channels are the ways users access specific services or get support for them. The service definition may list available channels and when to use each.
- **Incident / Request** — Incidents and service requests arrive through channels; channel selection affects how they are logged, triaged, and resolved.
- **Experience** — User experience varies by channel; experience management may be analyzed per channel so that improvements target the right path.

## Lifecycles

Channels themselves may be added, changed, or retired; the discipline often focuses on the *decision* and *evolution* of the channel mix:

1. **Evaluate** — Assess current channels: what is used, what works, what doesn’t. Identify gaps (e.g., no option for urgent, or self-service underused).
2. **Design / Adjust** — Decide which channels to offer for which services or request types; define scope (what each channel handles) and routing (how users are steered). Adjust existing channels (hours, scope, staffing) as needed.
3. **Operate** — Run the channels: staff them, maintain tools, monitor volume and performance. Route and escalate according to the design.
4. **Review** — Periodically review channel performance and user feedback; decide whether to add, change, or retire channels or adjust routing. Repeat.

Many organizations do not formalize these as stages; they "operate" continuously and "evaluate and adjust" when pain or opportunity appears.

## Getting Started

- **Minimal template:** For at least one service (or for "general support"), list the channels you offer (e.g., portal, phone, email) and document in one place: what each channel is for, when it is available, and how users reach it. Optionally: which request types or priorities each channel handles, and one or two performance metrics (e.g., volume, resolution rate). Review this when adding or changing channels or when users are confused about where to go.
- **When to introduce:** Introduce when users don’t know where to go for help or requests land in the wrong place; when one channel is overloaded while another is underused; or when the organization wants to shift volume (e.g., to self-service) but has no clear picture of current channels. Pain signals include "do I call or use the portal?," duplicate submissions across channels, and "we added chat but no one uses it."

## Processes

- **Defining channels:** The organization (often with service owners and support) decides which channels to offer for which services or request types. Each channel is described: scope, hours, how to access, and (where useful) typical use cases. This is documented and communicated to users.
- **Routing and steering:** Users are guided to the right channel via messaging (e.g., "for password reset use the portal"), tooling (e.g., portal suggests channel by request type), or support staff (e.g., "for this, use X"). Routing rules may be simple (everything goes to one queue) or differentiated by type, priority, or user.
- **Operating and monitoring:** Channels are staffed and maintained. Volume, resolution rate, cost per contact, and satisfaction are monitored so that the organization knows how each channel performs and where to improve or steer.
- **Evolving the mix:** Using performance and feedback, the organization periodically decides whether to add a channel (e.g., chat), retire one (e.g., underused email queue), or change scope or routing. Changes are communicated to users and staff.

## Adaptation

- **Channel mix:** Organizations differ in how many channels they offer and how they differentiate (e.g., by request type, priority, or user segment). Start with the channels you already have; document and rationalize before adding more. Add new channels when there is a clear need (e.g., "users want chat") and capacity to run them well.
- **Self-service vs. assisted:** The balance between self-service (portal, automation) and assisted (phone, chat, walk-up) depends on user capability, complexity of requests, and cost goals. Improve self-service where it can handle volume well; keep or improve assisted where human contact is needed.
- **Pitfalls:** Adding channels without clarifying scope so that users and staff are confused; measuring channels in isolation from experience so that "efficiency" (e.g., cost per contact) ignores user outcome; or designing the ideal channel mix without considering current behavior and adoption. Pilot and adjust based on real usage and feedback.
